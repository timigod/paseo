# Agent lifecycle

How an agent is created, runs, becomes a subagent, gets archived, and disappears from the UI. The model spans the daemon (lifecycle, archive) and the client (tabs, the subagents track).

## States

```
initializing → idle → running → idle (or error → closed)
                 ↑        │
                 └────────┘  (agent completes a turn, awaits next prompt)
```

Each agent in `AgentManager` carries a `lastStatus` of `initializing`, `idle`, `running`, `error`, or `closed`. State transitions persist to disk and stream to subscribed clients via WebSocket.

### Cancellation

Cancellation changes lifecycle state only after the provider acknowledges the interrupt or emits a terminal turn event. If the interrupt is rejected or times out, the agent remains `running` with its active foreground turn intact. Follow-up actions such as replacement, reload, rewind, and Stop must report that failure instead of accepting work they cannot perform. Synthesizing a local cancellation without provider acknowledgment creates a split-brain session: Paseo accepts a new prompt while the provider still owns the previous foreground turn.

## Relationships

Agents can launch other agents via the agent-scoped `create_agent` MCP tool. Agent-scoped creation is always asynchronous. `relationship` and `workspace` are separate decisions:

- `relationship` decides whether the new agent belongs under the caller.
- `workspace` decides where the new agent lives and whether a new workspace/worktree is created.

`relationship: { kind: "subagent" }` stamps the created agent with `paseo.parent-agent-id`, pointing back at the creating agent. The client surfaces that as `agent.parentAgentId`. This requires an agent-scoped MCP session.

`relationship: { kind: "detached" }` creates a sibling/root agent (e.g. handoffs, fire-and-forget delegations). The daemon may still use the creating agent for cwd/config inheritance, but it does not write `paseo.parent-agent-id`.

- **Subagents** — exist as part of the creating agent's work, appear in that agent's subagent track, and are archived with it.
- **Detached agents** — stand on their own, do not appear in the creating agent's subagent track, and are not archived with it.

`workspace: { kind: "current" }` uses the caller's workspace and can optionally override the runtime cwd. It requires an agent-scoped MCP session. `workspace: { kind: "create", source: { kind: "directory" | "worktree", ... } }` creates a new workspace for the new agent; worktree creation goes through the Paseo worktree workflow and stamps the agent with that fresh workspace id.

Users can also detach an existing subagent from the subagents track. Detach removes the `paseo.parent-agent-id` label only: it does not stop, archive, move, or restart the agent. The agent keeps its current `cwd` and `workspaceId`, leaves the former parent's track, and behaves like a root agent for tab close, workspace activity, and future parent archive.

`notifyOnFinish` defaults to `true` for agent-scoped creation and background prompt follow-ups because most delegated work needs to report back to the creating agent. Set it to `false` only for truly fire-and-forget agents or prompts.

## Archive

Archive is a **soft delete**: the agent record stays on disk with `archivedAt` set, the runtime is closed, and the agent disappears from active lists. Archive is **global** — it lives on the server and propagates to every connected client.

### Orchestrator finish and recovery

An idle turn is not the same thing as a finished task. Multi-step work often pauses for a
human decision, another agent, or a scheduled event. The public task surface is three commands:

```sh
paseo run --one-shot "..."
paseo continue <id> "..."
paseo finish <id>
```

`run --one-shot` is only for work that has one terminal answer. `continue` recovers an archived
task if necessary, then sends its next instruction; live tasks are sent without a restart.
`finish` archives the selected task. When that task is the sole owner of a Paseo-created
worktree, it releases that worktree too. It refuses to remove a shared worktree: other active
agents remain untouched and the result reports that the directory was kept. A running task
requires `--force`; otherwise the command fails rather than guessing that its current turn can be
abandoned.

`agent recover`, `agent send`, and `agent archive` remain advanced controls. Do not use a
wait-and-reload chain for live conversations.

`create_agent_request` can opt an agent into `autoArchive`. In that mode the daemon archives the agent after the first terminal turn event (`turn_completed`, `turn_failed`, or `turn_canceled`). If the same request created a Paseo worktree through its `worktree` field, auto-archive archives that worktree too, which removes the agent records inside the worktree.

Archiving runs through `AgentManager.archiveAgent` (`packages/server/src/server/agent/agent-manager.ts`):

1. Snapshot the current session into the registry
2. Set `archivedAt` and normalize `lastStatus` away from `running`/`initializing`
3. Notify subscribers
4. Close the runtime (kills the process if still running)
5. **Cascade-archive children** — any agent whose `paseo.parent-agent-id` label matches the archived agent gets archived too, recursively

Cascade is what keeps subagent fleets from outliving their orchestrator.

## Tabs vs archive

These are two distinct concepts that used to be conflated:

| Concept                    | Scope      | Triggers                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **Tab** (workspace layout) | Per-client | User opens/closes a view   |
| **Archive** (lifecycle)    | Global     | Explicit lifecycle gesture |

Closing a tab on a **root agent** still archives — the tab is the agent's home, so closing it means "I'm done with this agent." A confirm dialog protects against archiving a running agent by accident.

Closing a tab on a **subagent** (any agent with `parentAgentId`) is **layout-only**. The agent stays unarchived and stays in its parent's track. The user can re-open the tab from the track at any time. This is implemented in `handleCloseAgentTab` (`packages/app/src/screens/workspace/workspace-screen.tsx`).

The asymmetry is intentional: a subagent's persistent relationship lives in the parent's track. Same-workspace subagents are not auto-opened as tabs; the user opens one from that track when needed. A cross-workspace subagent is also auto-opened as a tab in its own workspace so opening that workspace does not appear empty. It remains in the parent's track until it is actually detached.

## Workspace activity

Agent lifecycle status stays literal: a parent agent is `idle` when its own turn is idle, even if a child is running.

Workspace status is an aggregate activity signal computed **per `workspaceId`**. Ownership is never derived from `cwd` — many workspaces may share one directory, and same-`cwd` siblings do not clump under one status. Root agents and cross-workspace subagents contribute their normal state bucket to their own workspace. Same-workspace descendants contribute `running` to the nearest ancestor in that workspace; their non-running attention, permission, and error states stay in the parent's subagents track. This makes a cross-workspace subagent behave like a detached agent for workspace visibility and status without removing its parent relationship.

## The subagents track

The collapsible track above the composer in an agent's pane (`packages/app/src/subagents/track.tsx`) combines two kinds of children:

- **Paseo subagents** are full managed agents. Their membership rule (`packages/app/src/subagents/select.ts`) is:

```
parentAgentId === thisAgent.id  AND  !archivedAt
```

- **Provider subagents** are child executions owned by Claude, Codex, or OpenCode. They are not inserted into `AgentManager` as managed agents. Providers emit a separate descriptor and timeline stream through `agent.provider_subagents.*`; the client keeps that state outside the normal agent store and merges only the presentation rows into the track.

Clicking either kind opens a workspace tab. A Paseo subagent tab is a normal interactive agent pane. A provider subagent tab is a read-only timeline pane with no composer, archive, detach, rewind, or fork actions. Both panes use `AgentStreamView`, so message, reasoning, tool-call, and layout rendering stay identical.

Provider timelines use the same structural timeline item format but deliberately have a separate lifecycle and transport. A provider thread/session identifier is not a Paseo agent identifier, and closing its tab is always layout-only.

Archived Paseo subagents disappear from the track, by design. To remove one from the track without closing its tab, use the **archive button** on the row — it opens a confirm dialog and archives the subagent on confirm. Provider-owned rows have no individual Paseo lifecycle controls.

The track header's **Archive finished** action hides finished provider-owned rows in the current app session. Their native sessions and timelines are untouched, and managed Paseo subagents are not archived by this bulk action. If a hidden provider child starts running again, the app brings it back to the track.

To keep the agent alive but remove it from the parent's track, use **detach**. The daemon clears the parent label, emits the normal agent update, and every client reclassifies the agent from subagent to root/sibling from that updated snapshot.

## Why this shape

The decision was to **decouple "close tab" from "archive" only for subagents**, rather than universally:

- **Closing a tab on a root agent still archives** — preserves the existing UX users are trained on
- **Closing a tab on a subagent is layout-only** — fixes the lossy "click to read, close to dismiss view, lose the row" flow
- **Archive button on track rows** — gives subagents an explicit lifecycle gesture in their home surface
- **Detach button on track rows** — lets a subagent continue independently without killing its work
- **Cascade archive on parent** — keeps subagents from leaking when the parent is archived

We considered universal decoupling (no tab close ever archives, archive is always explicit) but rejected it: it changes a behavior root-agent users rely on.

## Limitations

### Subagent accumulation under long-lived parents

A parent that spawns many subagents will see the track grow. Managed Paseo subagents can be archived individually. Finished provider-owned rows can be hidden together with **Archive finished**; this is app-local presentation state and resets when the app restarts.

### Cross-client tab dismissal

Closing a subagent's tab on one client doesn't affect other clients' layouts. This is the expected behavior of decoupled tabs and is consistent with how layouts have always worked. Archive remains the global gesture for cross-client cleanup.

## Storage

```
$PASEO_HOME/agents/{cwd-with-dashes}/{agent-id}.json
```

`{cwd-with-dashes}` is derived from the agent's filesystem `cwd`. It is not the workspace id; agent storage stays cwd-keyed while workspace identity is the opaque workspace id.

Each agent is a single JSON file. Fields relevant to this doc:
